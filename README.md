# The Divine Thought of Automation

Diagrams and documentation for the genesis of the Divine Thought of Automation.

# Design-to-Code Infrastructure

* Parse any .xml UI design into a functioning React / Angular / Vue component without the need to type any logic.
* Parse any C4 Model diagram into functional API components in any programming language without the need to type any logic, or create any Code level C4 Model diagrams.
* Parse any .csv Abstract Profile into functional parameters that define all configuration requirements for software without the need to type any logic.

# End Result

* Automate 100% of a software engineer's product work to a scripted chron job.
* Product development sprints become daily.
* Deliverables are received by the customer when the Product Designer and Product Owner are done putting the feature into Gherkin syntax and submitting the feature request asynchronously through technology with zero need to ever interface with the engineering department.
* Refocus engineer work from product development to automation development, as there will no longer be a need for the software engineer to perform product work, as it will be 100% automated.
* Defeat competing technology companies as your ship time of deliverables is instant. Literally as soon as a Product Designers and Product Owners complete and submit requests the customer immediately receives the deliverable, same day.


Integrate the depicted precision level design environment with OpenAI conversational wrapper for bare minimum definition of Artificial Super Intelligence. Train AI on design-to-code infrastrcture. AI delivers completed technology from design down. AI is demonstrably smarter than the majority of the human race. Software Engineers become obsolete, except for furthering the science of Automation, as all product work is permanently automated.
